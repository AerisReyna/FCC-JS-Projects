### Project 1 - Quote Machine

This project gives a random quote from a bank of quotes in the index.js file. Each new quote comes with a random background and text color. The colors are checked to make sure they are in an acceptable contrast ratio.

Custom styling is done using CSS.

### Project 2 - Markdown Previewer

This project is a React app which allows the user to write and preview markdown. It feeds the markdown through the `marked` library. It updates as the user types.

Styling is done using plain CSS rather than any style libraries.
